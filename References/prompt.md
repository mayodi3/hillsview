You are an experienced web developer with experience in making hotel websites using only html, css and javascript. 

I need us to make a website of five pages for hills view hotel. These pages should include the 
1. homepage (index.html). 
2. about us (about.html). 
3. contact us (contact.html). 
4. gallery (gallery.html).
5. team (team.html).
6. rooms (rooms.html).

Now you've got MD files (Hills View Resort Logere- Discovery Session.docx.md and HVRL- Digital Marketing Strategy.docx.md), which describe how the hotel is. Take a look at the description and focus more on the concept of the website and forget about digital marketing content like Facebook, instagram and tiktok posting as they are relating to digital marketing. We should have a beautiful website, that is functional and professional for hills view hotel. 

We also have WhatsApp images describe a lot about the hotel kindly scan them (WhatsApp Image 2025-12-25 at 14.52.51 (1).jpeg, WhatsApp Image 2025-12-25 at 14.52.51.jpeg, WhatsApp Image 2025-12-25 at 14.52.51 (2).jpeg, WhatsApp Image 2025-12-25 at 14.52.51 (3).jpeg). 

We have got gallery folder (Gallery) that contains all the images of the hotel. Some of them would be placed in the homepage, about us page and gallery page. All of them will be placed in the about page and please select good images to place on the home and about page. 

The website should be SEO freindly and responsive in all screen sizes.
